<!--#include file="header.inc"-->
This script is primarily the product of an included header
and included footer, which are both compiled into the 
script at compile time.  

<p>

When using includes, note that the script will recompile 
every time an included file changes.  Included files
may be used <b>anywhere</b> in a script, for perl or text.

<!--#include file="footer.inc"-->
