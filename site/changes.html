<font face="courier new" size=3><pre>
</pre></font>Apache::ASP has been in development since 1998, and 
was production ready since its .02 release.  Releases
are always used in a production setting before being
made publically available.
<font face="courier new" size=3><pre>
</pre></font>In July 2000, the version numbers of releases went 
from .19 to 1.9 which is more relevant to software development
outside the perl community.  Where a .10 perl module usually
means first production ready release, this would be the
equivalent of a 1.0 release for other kinds of software.
<font face="courier new" size=3><pre>
 + = improvement   - = bug fix    (d) = documentations

 - Bug fixes for running on standalone CGI mode on Win32 submitted
   by Francesco Pasqualini

 + Added Apache::ASP::Request::BINMODE for binmode() being
   called on STDIN after STDIN is tied to $Request object

 + New RequestBinaryRead configuration created, may be turned off
   to prevent $Request object from reading POST data

 ++ mod_perl 2 optmizations, there was a large code impact on this,
   as much code was restructured to reduce the differences between
   mod_perl 1 and mod_perl 2, most importantly, Apache::compat is
   no longer used

 + preloaded CGI for file uploads in the mod_perl environment

 - When XSLT config is set, $Response-&gt;Redirect() should work now
   Thanks to Marcus Zoller for pointing problem out

 + Added CookieDomain setting, documented, and added test to cover 
   it in t/cookies.t . Setting suggested by Uwe Riehm, who nicely 
   submitted some code for this.

 + XMLSubs tags with &quot;-&quot; in them will have &quot;-&quot; replaced with &quot;_&quot; or underscore, so a
   tag like &lt;my:render-table /&gt; will be translated to &amp;my::render_table() ... tags with
   - in them are common in extended XML syntaxes, but perl subs cannot have - in them only.

 + Clean setting now works on output when $Response-&gt;{ContentType} begins with text/html;
   like &quot;text/html; charset=iso-8859-2&quot; ... before Clean would only work on output marked
   with ContentType text/html.  Thanks to Szymon Juraszczyk for recommending fix.

 --Fixed a bug which would cause Session_OnEnd to be called twice on sessions in a certain case,
   particularly when an old expired session gets reused by and web browser... this bug was
   a result of a incomplete session cleanup method in this case.  Thanks to Oleg Kobyakovskiy 
   for reporting this bug.  Added test in t/session_events.t to cover this problem going forward.

 - Compile errors from Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader() were not being reported.  They will
   be reported again now.  Thanks to Thanos Chatziathanassiou for discovering and
   documenting this bug.  Added test in t/load.t to cover this problem going forward.

 + use of chr(hex($1)) to decode URI encoded parameters instead of pack(&quot;c&quot;,hex($1))
   faster &amp; more correct, thanks to Nikolay Melekhin for pointing out this need.

 (d) Added old perlmonth.com articles to ./site/articles in distribution
   and linked to them from the docs RESOURCES section

 (d) Updated documention for the $Application-&gt;SessionCount API

 + Scripts with named subroutines, which is warned against in the style guide,
   will not be cached to help prevent my closure problems that often
   hurt new developers working in mod_perl environments.  The downside
   is that these script will have a performance penalty having to be
   recompiled each invocation, but this will kill many closure caching 
   bugs that are hard to detect.

 - $Request-&gt;FileUpload(&#39;upload_file&#39;, &#39;BrowserFile&#39;) would return
   a glob before that would be the file name in scalar form.  However
   this would be interpreted as a reference incorrectly.  The fix
   is to make sure this is always a scalar by stringifying 
   this data internally.  Thanks to Richard Curtis for pointing
   out this bug.

 + added t/session_query_parse.t test to cover use of SessionQueryParse
   and $Server-&gt;URL APIs

 - Fixed duplicate &quot;&amp;&quot; bug associated with using $Server-&gt;URL 
   and SessionQueryParse together

 + Patch to allow $Server-&gt;URL() to be called multiple times on the same URL
   as in $Server-&gt;URL($Server-&gt;URL($url, \%params), \%more_params)

 (d) Added new testimonials &amp; sites &amp; created a separate testimonials page.

 - SessionQueryParse will now add to &amp;amp; to the query strings
   embedded in the HTML, instead of &amp; for proper HTML generation.
   Thanks to Peter Galbavy for pointing out and Thanos Chatziathanassiou
   for suggesting the fix.

 - $Response-&gt;{ContentType} set to text/html for developer error reporting,
   in case this was set to something else before the error occured.
   Thanks to Philip Mak for reporting.

 - Couple of minor bug fixes under PerlWarn use, thanks Peter Galbavy
   for reporting.

 + Added automatic load of &quot;use Apache2&quot; for compat with mod_perl2 
   request objects when Apache::ASP is loaded via &quot;PerlModule Apache::ASP&quot;
   Thanks to Richard Curtis for reporting bug &amp; subsequent testing.

 - When GlobalPackage config changes, but global.asa has not, global.asa
   will be recompiled anyway to update the GlobalPackage correctly.
   Changing GlobalPackage before would cause errors if global.asa was
   already compiled.

 ++ For ANY PerlSetVar type config, OFF/Off/off will be assumed 
    to have value of 0 for that setting.  Before, only a couple settings
    had this semantics, but they all do now for consistency.

 - Fix for InodeNames config on OpenBSD, or any OS that might have
   a device # of 0 for the file being stat()&#39;d, thanks to Peter Galbavy
   for bug report.

 ++ Total XSLT speedups, 5-10% on large XSLT, 10-15% on small XSLT

 + bypass meta data check like expires for XSLT Cache() API use
   because XSLT tranformations don&#39;t expire, saves hit to cache dbm
   for meta data

 + use of direct Apache::ASP::State methods like FETCH/STORE
   in Cache() layer so we don&#39;t have to go through slower tied interface.
   This will speed up XSLT &amp; and include output caching mostly.

 + minor optimizations for speed &amp; memory usage

 ++ Runtime speed enhancements for 15-20% improvement including:
   + INTERNAL API ReadFile() now returns scalar ref as memory optimization
   + cache InodeNames config setting in ASP object now for common lookups
   + removed CompileChecksum() INTERNAL API, since it was an unnecesary
     method decomposition along a common code path
   + removed IsChanged() INTERNAL API since compiling of scripts
     is now handled by CompileInclude() which does this functionality already
   + removed unnecessary decomp of IncludesChanged() INTERNAL API, which was along
     critical code path
   + do not call INTERNAL SearchDirs() API when compiling base script
     since we have already validated its path earlier
   + Use stat(_) type shortcut for stat() &amp; -X calls where possible
   + Moved @INC initilization up to handler() &amp; consolidated with $INCDir lib
   + removed useless Apache::ASP::Collection::DESTROY
   + removed useless Apache::ASP::Server::DESTROY
   + removed useless Apache::ASP::GlobalASA::DESTROY
   + removed useless Apache::ASP::Response::DESTROY

 - Default path for $Response-&gt;{Cookies} was from CookiePath
   config, but this was incorrect as CookiePath config is only
   for $Session cookie, so now path for $Response-&gt;{Cookies}
   defaults to /

 - Fixed bug where global.asa events would get undefined with
   StatINC and GlobalPackage set when the GlobalPackage library
   changed &amp; get reloaded.

 (d) Documented long time config NoCache.

 -- Fixed use with Apache::Filter, capable as both source
    and destination filter.  Added <a href=eg/filter.filter>./site/eg/filter.filter</a> example
    to demonstrate these abilities.

 + Use $r-&gt;err_headers_out-&gt;add Apache::Table API for cookies 
   now instead of $r-&gt;cgi_header_out.  Added t/cookies.t test to 
   cover new code path as well as general $Response-&gt;Cookies API.
   Also make cookies headers sorted by cookie and dictionary key 
   while building headers for repeatable behavior, this latter was 
   to facilitate testing.

 - fixed $Server-&gt;Mail error_log output when failing to connect
   to SMTP server.

 + added tests to cover UniquePackages &amp; NoCache configs since this
   config logic was updated

 + made deprecated warnings for use of certain $Response-&gt;Member
   calls more loudly write to error_log, so I can remove the AUTOLOAD
   for Response one day

 - Probably fixed behavior in CgiHeaders, at least under perl 5.8.0, and
   added t/cgi_headers.t to cover this config.

 + removed $Apache::ASP::CompressGzip setting ability, used to possibly
   set CompressGzip in the module before, not documented anyway

 + removed $Apache::ASP::Filter setting ability to set Filter globally, 
   not documented anyway

 + removed old work around for setting ServerStarting to 0
   at runtime, which was bad for Apache::DBI on win32 a long
   time ago:

    $Apache::ServerStarting and $Apache::ServerStarting = 0;

   If this code is still needed in Apache::ASP-&gt;handler() let
   me know.

 + check to make sure data in internal database is a HASH ref
   before using it for session garbage collection.  This is to
   help prevent against internal database corruption in a 
   network share that does not support flock() file locking.

 + For new XMLSubs ASP type &lt;%= %&gt; argument interpolation
   activated with XMLSubsPerlArgs 0, data references can now
   be passed in addition to SCALAR/string references, so one
   can pass an object reference like so:

     &lt;my:tag value=&quot;&lt;%= $Object %&gt;&quot; /&gt;

   This will only work as long as the variable interpolation &lt;%= %&gt;
   are flushed against the containing &quot; &quot; or &#39; &#39;, or else the object
   reference will be stringified when it is concatenated with 
   the rest of the data.

   Testing for this feature was added to ./t/xmlsubs_aspargs.t

   This feature is still experimental, and its interface may change.
   However it is slated for the 3.0 release as default method,
   so feedback is appreciated.

 + For new XMLSubs ASP type &lt;%= %&gt; argument interpolation
   activated with XMLSubsPerlArgs 0, &lt;% %&gt; will no longer work,
   just &lt;%= %&gt;, as in 

     &lt;my:tag value=&quot;some value &lt;%= $value %&gt; more data&quot; /&gt;

   This feature is still experimental, and its interface may change.
   However it is slated for the 3.0 release as default method,
   so feedback is appreciated.

 ++New XMLSubsPerlArgs config, default 1, indicates how 
  XMLSubs arguments have always been parsed.  If set to 0,
  will enable new XMLSubs args that are more ASP like with
  &lt;%= %&gt; for dynamic interpolation, such as:

    &lt;my:xmlsub arg=&quot;&lt;%= $data %&gt;&quot; arg2=&quot;text &lt;%= $data2 %&gt;&quot; /&gt;
 
  Settings XMLSubsPerlArgs to 0 is experimental for now, but
  will become the default by Apache::ASP version 3.0

 ++Optimization for static HTML/XML files that are served up 
  via Apache::ASP so that they are not compiled into perl subroutines
  first.  This makes especially native XSLT both faster &amp; take
  less memory to serve, before XSL &amp; XML files being transformed
  by XSLT would both be compiled as normal ASP script first, so 
  now this will happen if they really are ASP scripts with embedded
  &lt;% %&gt; code blocks &amp; XMLSubs being executed.

 +Consolidate some config data for Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader to use
  globals in @Apache::ASP::CompileChecksumKeys to know which 
  config data is important for precompiling ASP scripts.

 +Further streamlined code compilation.  Now both base
  scripts and includes use the internal CompileInclude() API
  to generate code.

 -Fixed runtime HTML error output when Debug is set to -2/2,
  so that script correctly again gets rendered in final perl form.
  Added compile time error output to <a href=eg/syntax_error.asp>./site/eg/syntax_error.asp</a>
  when a special link is clicked for a quick visual test.

 -Cleaned up some bad coding practices in <a href=eg/global.asa>./site/eg/global.asa</a>
  associated changes in other example files.  Comment example
  global.asa some for the first time reader

 -DemoASP.pm examples module needed &quot;use strict&quot; fix, thanks
  to Allan Vest for bug report

 --$rv = $Response-&gt;Include({ File =&gt; ..., Cache =&gt; 1});
  now works to get the first returned value fetched from
  the cache.  Before, because a list was always returned,
  $rv would have been equal to the number of items returned,
  even if the return value list has just one element.

 (d) added site/robots.txt file with just a comment for
     search engine indexing

 -fixed <a href=eg/binary_write.htm>./site/eg/binary_write.htm</a> to not use 
  $Response-&gt;{ContentLength} because it does not exist.
  Fixed it to use $Response-&gt;AddHeader now instead

 -Turn off $^W explicitly before reloading global.asa.  Reloading
  global.asa when $^W is set will trigger subroutine redefinition
  warnings.  Reloading global.asa should occur without any problems
  under normal usage of the system, thus this work around.

  This fix is important to UseStrict functionality because warnings
  automatically become thrown as die() errors with UseStrict enabled,
  so we have to disable normal soft warnings here.

 -$Response-&gt;Include() runtime errors now throw a die() that
  can be trapped.  This was old functionality that has been restored.
  Other compile time errors should still trigger a hard error
  like script compilation, global.asa, or $Response-&gt;Include()
  without an eval()

 +Some better error handling with Debug 3 or -3 set, cleaned
  up developer errors messages somewhat.

  generates its testing directory structures at runtime.

 +SessionQueryForce setting created for disabling use of cookies
  for $Session session-id passing, rather requiring use of SessionQuery*
  functionality for session-id passing via URL query string.

  By default, even when SessionQuery* options are used, cookies will
  be used if available with SessionQuery* functionality acting only
  as a backup, so this makes it so that cookies will never be used.

 +Escape &#39; with HTMLEncode() to &amp;#39;

 -Trying to fix t/server_mail.t to work better for platforms
  that it should skip testing on.  Updated t/server.t test case.

 +Remove exit() from Makefile.PL so CPAN.pm&#39;s automatic
  follow prereq mechanism works correctly.  Thanks to Slaven Rezic
  for pointing this out.

 +Added Apache::compat loading in mod_perl environment for better
  mod_perl 2.0 support.

  it looked like the ASP object state became invalid.

 - fixed up t/server_mail.t test to skip if a sendmail server
   is not available on localhost.  We only want the test to run
   if there is a server to test against.

 + removed cgi/asp script, just a symlink now to the ./asp-perl script
   which in this way deprecates it.  I had it hard linked, but the 
   distribution did not untar very well on win32 platform.

 + Reordered the modules in Bundle::Apache::ASP for a cleaner install.

 - Fixed bug where XMLSubs where removing &lt;?xml version ... ?&gt; tag
   when it was needed in XSLT mode.

 + $Server-&gt;Mail({ CC =&gt; &#39;...&#39;, BCC =&gt; &#39;...&#39; }), now works to send
   CC &amp; BCC headers/recipients.

 + Removed $Apache::ASP::Register definition which defined the current
   executing Apache::ASP object.  Only one part of the application was
   using it, and this has been fixed.  This would have been an unsafe
   use of globals for a threaded environment.

 + Decreased latency when doing Application_OnStart, used to sleep(1) 
   for CleanupMaster sync, but this is not necessary for Application_OnStart 
   scenario

 + Restructure code / core templates for MailErrorsTo funcationality.  
   Wrote test mail_error.t to cover this.  $ENV{REMOTE_USER} will now 
   be displayed in the MailErrorsTo message when defined from 401 basic auth.

 + $Server-&gt;RegisterCleanup should be thread safe now, as it no longer relies
   on access to @Apache::ASP::Cleanup for storing the CODE ref stack.

 + test t/inode_names.t for InodeNames and other file tests covering case
   of long file names.

 - Fixed long file name sub identifier bug.  Added test t/long_names.t.

 + CacheDir may now be set independently of StateDir.  It used to default
   to StateDir if it was set.

 ++ Decomposition of modules like Apache::ASP::Session &amp; Apache::ASP::Application
   out of ASP.pm file.  This should make the source more developer friendly.  

   This selective code compilation also speeds up CGI requests that do not 
   need to load unneeded modules like Apache::ASP::Session, by about 50%,
   so where CGI mode ran at about 2.1 hits/sec before, now for 
   light requests that do not load $Session &amp; $Application, requests
   run at 3.4 hits/sec, this is on a dual PIII-450 linux 2.4.x

 - Caching like for XSLTCache now works in CGI mode.  
   This was a bug that it did not before.

 + $Server-&gt;File() API added, acts as a wrapper around 
   Apache-&gt;request-&gt;filename Added test in t/server.t

 ++  *** EXPERIMENTAL / ALPHA FEATURE NOTE BEGIN ***

   New $PERLLIB/Apache/ASP/Share/ directory created to 
   hold system &amp; user contributed components, which will be found
   on the $Server-&gt;MapInclude() path, which helps $Response-&gt;Include
   search &#39;.&#39;,Global,IncludesDir, and now Apache::ASP::Share for
   includes to load at runtime.  

   The syntax for loading a shared include is to prefix the file
   name with Share:: as in:

    $Response-&gt;TrapInclude(&#39;Share::CORE/MailError.inc&#39;);

   New test to cover this at t/share.t

   This feature is experimental.  The naming convention may change
   and the feature may disappear altogether, so only use if you
   are interesting in experimenting with this feature &amp; will
   provide feedback about how it works.

   *** EXPERIMENTAL / ALPHA FEATURE NOTE END ***

 + asp-perl script now uses ./asp.conf instead of ./asp.config
   for runtime configuration via %Config defined there.  Update docs
   for running in standalone CGI mode

 + Make use of MANFEST.SKIP to not publish the dev/* files anymore.

 - Script_OnEnd guaranteed to run after $Response-&gt;End, but 
   it will not run if there was an error earlier in the request.

 + lots of new test cases covering behaviour of $Response-&gt;End
   and $Response-&gt;Redirect under various conditions like XMLSubs
   and SoftRedirect and global.asa Script_OnStart

 + asp-perl will be installed into the bin executables when
   Apache::ASP is installed.  asp-perl is the command line version
   of Apache::ASP that can also be used to run script in CGI mode.
   Test case covering asp-perl functionality.

 + asp CGI/command line script now called asp-perl.  I picked this 
   name because Apache::ASP often has the name asp-perl in distributions
   of the module.

 + Apache::ASP::CGI::Test class now subclass of Apache::ASP::CGI.  To facilitate
   this Apache::ASP::CGI::init() now called OO like Apache::ASP::CGI-&gt;init()
   Fixed up places where the old style was called.  New Test class allows
   a dummy Apache request object to be built which caches header &amp; body output
   for later inspection instead of writing it to STDOUT.

 - $Response-&gt;Redirect() under SoftRedirect 1 will not first Clear() buffer

 - $Response-&gt;Redirect() in an XMLSubs will work now ... behavior
   of $Response-&gt;Flush() being turned off in an XMLSubs was interfering with this.

 + srand() init tracking done better, thanks for patch from Ime Smits

 + Added file/directory being used for precompilation in 
   Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader($file, ...) to output like:

    [Mon Feb 04 20:19:22 2002] [error] [asp] 4215 (re)compiled 22 scripts 
      of 22 loaded for $file

   This is so that when precompiling multiple web sites
   each with different directories, one can easier see the 
   compile output relevant to the Loader() command being run.

 + better decomp of Apache::ASP site build files at ./build/* files,
   which is good should anyone look at it for ideas.

 + improved test suite to error when unintended output results from
   t/*.t test scripts.

 - () now supported in XMLSubsMatch config, added xmlsubsmatch.t test...
   specifically a config like 

     PerlSetVar (aaa|bbb):\w+ 

   should now work.  Thanks for bug report from David Kulp.

 + Added an early srand() for better $ServerID creation

 + Work around for DSO problems where $r is not always correctly 
   defined in Apache::ASP::handler().  Thanks to Tom Lear for patch.

 + $Server-&gt;MapInclude() API extension created to wrap up Apache::ASP::SearchDirs 
   functionality so one may do an conditional check for an include existence befor 
   executing $Response-&gt;Include().  Added API test to server.t

 + $Server-&gt;Transfer() now allows arguments like $Response-&gt;Include(), and now acts just
   as a wrapper for:

     $Response-&gt;Include($file, @args);
     $Response-&gt;End();

   added test case at t/server_transfer.t

 + Removed dependency of StatINC functionality on Apache::Symbol.  Apache::Symbol 
   is no longer required.  Added test of t/stat_inc.t for correct StatINC initialization
   for platforms where Devel::Symdump is present.

 + Better error message when $Request-&gt;Params has not been defined with RequestParams
   config &amp; it gets used in script.  Added test case as t/request_params_none.t

 + Directories cannot now be included as scripts via $Response-&gt;Include(), added
   test case to t/include.t

 - No longer make $Response-&gt;Flush dependent on $Response-&gt;IsClientConnected() to 
   be true to write output to client.  There have been spurious errors reported
   about the new ( &gt;= 2.25 ) IsClientConnected code, and this will limit the impact 
   of that functionality possibly not working still to those users explicitly using 
   that API.

 + $Response-&gt;AddHeader($header_name, $value) now will set $Response members
   for these headers: Content-Type, Cache-Control, Expires.  This is to avoid
   both the application &amp; Apache::ASP sending out duplicate headers.  Added
   test cases for this to t/response.t

 + split up Bundle::Apache::ASP into that, and Bundle::Apache::ASP::Extra
   the former with just the required modules to run, and the latter 
   for extra functionality in Apache::ASP

 + new $Request-&gt;{Method} member to return $r-&gt;method of GET or POST that 
   client browser is requesting, added t/request.t sub test to cover this member.

 +Added some extra help text to the ./cgi/asp --help message
  to clarify how to pass arguments to a script from the command line.

 +When using $Server-&gt;Mail() API, if Content-Type header is set,
  and MIME-Version is not, then a &quot;MIME-Version: 1.0&quot; header will be sent
  for the email.  This is correct according to RFC 1521 which specifies
  for the first time the Content-Type: header for email documents.
  Thanks to Philip Mak for pointing out this correct behavior.

 +Made dependent on MLDBM::Sync version .25 to pass the taint_check.t test

 +Improved server_mail.t test to work with mail servers were relaying is denied

 +Added &lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt; tags to MailErrorsTo email

 --Fixed SessionCount / Session_OnEnd bug, where these things were not
  working for $Sessions that never had anything written to them.
  This bug was introduced in 2.23/2.25 release.

  There was an optimization in 2.23/2.25 where a $Session that was never
  used does not write its state lock file &amp; dbm files to disk, only if
  it gets written too like $Session-&gt;{MARK}++.  Tracking of these NULL $Sessions 
  then is handled solely in the internal database.  For $Session garbage 
  collection though which would fire Session_OnEnd events and update 
  SessionCount, the Apache::ASP::State-&gt;GroupMembers() function was just 
  looking for state files on disk ... now it looks in the internal database 
  too for SessionID records for garbage collection.

  Added a test at ./t/session_events.t for these things.

 +Some optimizations for $Session API use.

 +Added support for XSLT via XML::LibXSLT, patch courtesy of Michael Buschauer

 -Got rid of an warning when recompiling changing includes under perl 5.6.1...
  undef($code) method did not work for this perl version, rather undef(&amp;$code) does.
  Stopped using using Apache::Symbol for this when available.

 -Make Apache::ASP script run under perl taint checking -T for perl 5.6.1...
  $code =~ tr///; does not work to untaint here, so much use the slower:
  $code =~ /^(.*)$/s; $code = $1; method to untaint.

 -Check for inline includes changing, included in a dynamic included
  loaded at runtime via $Response-&gt;Include().  Added test case for
  this at t/include_change.t.  If an inline include of a dynamic include
  changes, the dynamic include should get recompiled now.

 -Make OK to use again with PerlTaintCheck On, with MLDBM::Sync 2.25.
  Fixed in ASP.pm, t/global.asa, and created new t/taint_check.t test script

 +Load more modules when Apache::ASP is loaded so parent will share more
  with children httpd: 
   Apache::Symbol 
   Devel::Symdump 
   Config 
   lib 
   MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File

 +When FileUploadMax bytes is exceeded for a file upload, there will not
  be an odd error anymore resulting from $CGI::POST_MAX being triggered,
  instead the file upload input will simply be ignored via $CGI::DISABLE_UPLOADS.
  This gives the developer the opportunity to tell the user the the file upload
  was too big, as demonstrated by the <a href=eg/file_upload.asp>./site/eg/file_upload.asp</a> example.

  To not let the web client POST a lot of data to your scripts as a form
  of a denial of service attack use the apache config LimitRequestBody for the 
  max limits.  You can think of PerlSetVar FileUploadMax as a soft limit, and 
  apache&#39;s LimitRequestBody as a hard limit.

 --Under certain circumstances with file upload, it seems that IsClientConnected() 
  would return an aborted client value from $r-&gt;connection-&gt;aborted, so
  the buffer output data would not be flushed to the client, and 
  the HTML page would return to the browser empty.  This would be under
  normal file upload use.  One work-around was to make sure to initialize
  the $Request object before $Response-&gt;IsClientConnected is called,
  then $r-&gt;connection-&gt;aborted returns the right value.
  
  This problem was probably introduced with IsClientConnected() code changes
  starting in the 2.25 release.

 + Wrapped call to $r-&gt;connection-&gt;fileno in eval {} so to 
   preserve backwards compatibility with older mod_perl versions
   that do not have this method defined.  Thanks to Helmut Zeilinger
   for catching this.

 + removed ./dev directory from distribution, useless clutter

 + Removed dependency on HTTP::Date by taking code into
   Apache::ASP as Apache::ASP::Date.  This relieves
   the dependency of Apache::ASP on libwww LWP libraries.
   If you were using HTTP::Date functions before without loading
   &quot;use HTTP::Date;&quot; on your own, you will have to do this now.

 + Streamlined code execution.  Especially worked on 
   $Response-&gt;IsClientConnected which gets called during
   a normal request execution, and got rid of IO::Select
   dependency. Some function style calls instead of OO style 
   calls where private functions were being invokes that one 
   would not need to override.

 - Fixed possible bug when flushing a data buffer where there
   is just a &#39;0&#39; in it.

 + Updated docs to note that StateCache config was deprecated
   as of 2.23.  Removed remaining code that referenced the config.

 + Removed references to unused OrderCollections code.

 - Better Cache meta key, lower chance of collision with 
   unrelated data since its using the full MD5 keyspace now

 + Optimized some debugging statements that resulted 
   from recent development.

 + Tie::TextDir .04 and above is supported for StateDB
   and CacheDB settings with MLDBM::Sync .21. This is good for 
   CacheDB where output is larger and there are not many 
   versions to cache, like for XSLTCache, where the site is 
   mostly static.

 + Better RESOURCES section to web site, especially with adding
   some links to past Apache::ASP articles &amp; presentations.

   Make use of MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File, where search database
   before was engineering around SDBM_File&#39;s shortcomings.

 +Make sure a couple other small standard modules get loaded
  upon &quot;PerlModule Apache::ASP&quot;, like Time::HiRes, Class::Struct,
  and MLDBM::Serializer::Data::Dumper.  If not available
  these modules won&#39;t cause errors, but will promote child httpd
  RAM sharing if they are.

 -XMLSubs args parsing fix so an arg like z-index
  does not error under UseStrict.  This is OK now:

   &lt;my:layer z-index=3 top=0 left=0&gt; HTML &lt;/my:layer&gt;

 -Only remove outermost &lt;SCRIPT&gt; tags from global.asa
  for IIS/PerlScript compatibility.  Used to remove
  all &lt;SCRIPT&gt; tags, which hurt when some subs in globa.asa
  would be printing some JavaScript.

 +$Response-&gt;{IsClientConnected} now updated correctly 
  before global.asa Script_OnStart.  $Response-&gt;IsClientConnect()
  can be used for accurate accounting, while 
  $Response-&gt;{IsClientConnected} only gets updated
  after $Response-&gt;Flush().  Added test cases to response.t

 +$Server-&gt;HTMLEncode(\$data) API extension, now can take
  scalar ref, which can give a 5% improvement in benchmarks
  for data 100K in size.

 -Access to $Application is locked when Application_OnEnd &amp; 
  Application_OnStart is called, creating a critical section
  for use of $Application

 ++MLDBM::Sync used now for core DBM support in Apache::ASP::State.
  This drastically simplifies/stabilizes the code in there
  and will make it easier for future SQL database plugins.

 +New API for accessing ASP object information in non content
  handler phases:

    use Apache::ASP;
    sub My::Auth::handler {
      my $r = shift;
      my $ASP = Apache::ASP-&gt;new($r) 
      my $Session = $ASP-&gt;Session;
    }

  In the above example, $Session would be the same $Session
  object created later while running the ASP script for this
  same request.  

  Added t/asp_object.t test for this.  Fixed global.asa to only 
  init StateDir when application.asp starts which is the first 
  test script to run.

 -Fixed on Win32 to make Apache::ASP-&gt;new($r) able to create
  multiple master ASP objects per request.  Was not reentrant 
  safe before, particularly with state locking for dbms like 
  $Application &amp; $Session.  

 ++Output caching for includes, built on same layer ( extended )
  as XSLTCache, test suite at t/cache.t.  Enabled with special 
  arguments to 

    $Response-&gt;Include(\%args, @include_args)
    $Response-&gt;TrapInclude(\%args, @include_args)
    $Server-&gt;Execute(\%args, @include_args)

  where %args = (
    File =&gt; &#39;file.inc&#39;,
    Cache =&gt; 1, # to activate cache layer
    Expires =&gt; 3600, # to expire in one hour
    LastModified =&gt; time() - 600, # to expire if cached before 10 minutes ago
    Key =&gt; $Request-&gt;Form, # to cache based on checksum of serialized form data,
    Clear =&gt; 1, # to not allow fetch from cache this time, will always execute include
  );

  Like the XSLTCache, it uses MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File
  by default, but can use DB_File or GDBM_File if
  CacheDB is set to these.

  See t/cache.t for API support until this is documented.

 +CacheSize now supports units of M, K, B like 

   CacheSize 10M
   CacheSize 10240K
   CacheSize 10000000B
   CacheSize 10000000

 -Better handling of $Session-&gt;Abandon() so multiple
  request to the same session while its being destroyed
  will have the right effect.

 +Optimized XMLSubs parsing.  Scripts with lots lof XMLSubs 
  now parse faster for the first time.  One test script with 
  almost 200 such tags went from a parse time of around 3 seconds
  to .7 seconds after optimizations.

 +Updated performance tuning docs, particularly for using
  Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader()

 +$Server-&gt;URL($url, \%params) now handles array refs
  in the params values like
    $Server-&gt;URL($url, { key =&gt; [ qw( value1 value2 ) ] })

  This is so that query string data found in 
  $Request-&gt;QueryString that gets parsed into this form
  from a string like: ?key=value&amp;key=value2 would be 
  able to be reused passed back to $Server-&gt;URL to 
  create self referencing URLs more easily.

 -Bug fix where XMLSubs like &lt;s:td /&gt; now works on perl 
  5.005xx, thanks to Philip Mak for reporting &amp; fix.

 +When searching for included files, will now join
  the absolute path of the directory of the script
  with the name of the file if its a relative file
  name like ./header.inc.  Before, would just look
  for something like ././header.inc by using &#39;.&#39;
  as the first directory to look for includes in.

  The result of this is that scripts in two directories
  configured with the same Global setting should be able
  to have separate local header.inc files without causing
  a cached namespace collision.

 +$Server-&gt;Config() call will return a hash ref 
  to all the config setting for that request, like
  Apache-&gt;dir_config would.

 -StatINC setting with Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader() works again.
  This makes StatINC &amp; StatINCMatch settings viable 
  for production &amp; development use when the system has
  very many modules.

 -Cookieless session support with configs like SessionQueryParse
  and SessionQuery now work for URLs with frags in them
  like <tt>http://localhost?arg=value#frag</tt>

 +@rv = $Response-&gt;Include() now works where there are
  multiple return values from an include like:
  &lt;% return(1,2); %&gt;

 -push Global directory onto @INC during ASP script execution
  Protect contents of original @INC with local.  This makes

  Global in @INC.  Fixed needed by Henrik Tougaard

 - ; is a valid separator like &amp; for QueryString Parameters
  Fixed wanted by Anders

 -XSMLSubsMatch doc fix in CONFIG section

 +Reduces number of Session groups to 16 from 32, so 
  session manager for small user sets will be that much faster.

 +optimizations for internal database, $Application, and $Session
  creation.

 +XSLTCache must be set for XSLT caching to begin using CacheDir

 +CacheDB like StateDB bug sets dbm format for caching, which
  defaults to MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File, which works well for caching
  output sizes &lt; 50K

 +CacheDir config for XSLT caching ... defaults to StateDir

 +CacheSize in bytes determines whether the caches in CacheDir
  are deleted at the end of the request.  A cache will be 
  reset in this way back to 0 bytes. Defaults to 10000000 bytes
  or about 10M.

 +Caching infrastructure work that is being used in XSLT
  can be leveraged later for output caching of includes,
  or arbitrary user caching.

 -t/server_mail.t test now uses valid email for testing
  purposes ... doesn&#39;t actually send a mail, but for SMTP
  runtime validation purposes it should be OK.

 +fixed where POST data was read from under MOD_PERL,
  harmless bug this was that just generated the wrong

  be the error &quot;need id for includes&quot; when using
  $Response-&gt;Include() ... if DynamicIncludes were
  enabled, this problem would not have likely occured
  anyway.  DynamicIncludes are preferrable to use so

 +$Response-&gt;{IsClientConnected} now will be set

  $Response-&gt;Flush()

 +New XSLTParser config which can be set to XML::XSLT or
  XML::Sablotron.  XML::Sablotron renders 10 times faster, 
  but differently.  XML::XSLT is pure perl, so has wider
  platform support than XML::Sablotron.  This config affects
  both the XSLT config and the $Server-&gt;XSLT() method.

 +New $Server-&gt;XSLT(\$xsl_data, \$xml_data) API which 
  allows runtime XSLT on components instead of having to process
  the entire ASP output as XSLT.  

 -XSLT support for XML::XSL 0.32.  Things broke after .24.

 -XSLTCacheSize config no longer supported.  Was a bad 
  Tie::Cache implementation.  Should be file based cache
  to greatly increases cache hit ratio.

 ++$Response-&gt;Include(), $Response-&gt;TrapInclude(),
  and $Server-&gt;Execute() will all take a scalar ref
  or \&#39;asdfdsafa&#39; type code as their first argument to execute 
  a raw script instead of a script file name.  At this time, 
  compilation of such a script, will not be cached.  It is 
  compiled/executed as an anonymous subroutine and will be freed
  when it goes out of scope.

 + -p argument to cgi/asp script to set GlobalPackage
  config for static site builds

 -pod commenting fix where windows clients are used for 
  ASP script generation.

 +Some nice performance enhancements, thank to submissions from
  Ime Smits.  Added some 1-2% per request execution speed.

 +Added StateDB MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File support for faster
  $Session + $Application than DB_File, yet still overcomes
  SDBM_File&#39;s 1024 bytes value limitation.  Documented in 
  StateDB config, and added Makefile.PL entry.

 +Removed deprecated MD5 use and replace with Digest::MD5 calls

 +PerlSetVar InodeNames 1 config which will compile scripts hashed by 
  their device &amp; inode identifiers, from a stat($file)[0,1] call.
  This allows for script directories, the Global directory,
  and IncludesDir directories to be symlinked to without
  recompiling identical scripts.  Likely only works on Unix
  systems.  Thanks to Ime Smits for this one.

 +Streamlined code internally so that includes &amp; scripts were
  compiled by same code.  This is a baby step toward fusing
  include &amp; script code compilation models, leading to being
  able to compile bits of scripts on the fly as ASP subs, 
  and being able to garbage collect ASP code subroutines.

 -removed @_ = () in script compilation which would trigger warnings 
  under PerlWarn being set, thanks for Carl Lipo for reporting this.

 -StatINC/StatINCMatch fix for not undeffing compiled includes
  and pages in the GlobalPackage namespace

 -Create new HTML::FillInForm object for each FormFill
  done, to avoid potential bug with multiple forms filled
  by same object.  Thanks to Jim Pavlick for the tip.

 +Added PREREQ_PM to Makefile.PL, so CPAN installation will
  pick up the necessary modules correctly, without having
  to use Bundle::Apache::ASP, thanks to Michael Davis. 

 + &gt; mode for opening lock files, not &gt;&gt;, since its faster

 +$Response-&gt;Flush() fixed, by giving $| = 1 perl hint
  to $r-&gt;print() and the rest of the perl sub.

 +$Response-&gt;{Cookies}{cookie_name}{Expires} = -86400 * 300;
  works so negative relative time may be used to expire cookies.

 +Count() + Key() Collection class API implementations

 +Added editors/aasp.vim VIM syntax file for Apache::ASP,
  courtesy of Jon Topper.

 ++Better line numbering with #line perl pragma.  Especially
  helps with inline includes.  Lots of work here, &amp; integrated
  with Debug 2 runtime pretty print debugging.

 +$Response-&gt;{Debug} member toggles on/off whether 
  $Response-&gt;Debug() is active, overriding the Debug setting
  for this purpose.  Documented.

 -When Filter is on, Content-Length won&#39;t be set and compression
  won&#39;t be used.  These things would not work with a filtering
  handler after Apache::ASP

 +Examples in ./site/eg are now UseStrict friendly.  
  Also fixed up <a href=eg/ssi_filter.ssi>./site/eg/ssi_filter.ssi</a> example.

 +Auto purge of old stale session group directories, increasing 
  session manager performance when using Sessions when migrating
  to Apache::ASP 2.09+ from older versions.

 +SessionQueryParse now works for all $Response-&gt;{ContentType}
  starting with &#39;text&#39; ... before just worked with text/html,
  now other text formats like wml will work too. 

 +32 groups instead of 64, better inactive site session group purging.

 +Default session-id length back up to 32 hex bytes.
  Better security vs. performance, security more important,
  especially when performance difference was very little.

 +PerlSetVar RequestParams 1 creates $Request-&gt;Params
  object with combined contents of $Request-&gt;QueryString

 ++FormFill feature via HTML::FillInForm.  Activate with
  $Response-&gt;{FormFill} = 1 or PerlSetVar FormFill 1
  See site/eg/formfill.asp for example.

 ++XMLSubs tags of the same name may be embedded in each other
  recursively now.

 +No umask() use on Win32 as it seems unclear what it would do

 +simpler Apache::ASP::State file handle mode of &gt;&gt; when opening 
  lock file.  saves doing a -e $file test.

 +AuthServerVariables config to init $Request-&gt;ServerVariables
  with basic auth data as documented.  This used to be default
  behavior, but triggers &quot;need AuthName&quot; warnings from recent
  versions of Apache when AuthName is not set.

 -Renamed Apache::ASP::Loader class to Apache::ASP::Load
  as it collided with the Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader() function
  namespace.  Class used internally by Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader()
  so no public API changed here.

 +-Read of POST input for $Request-&gt;BinaryRead() even

   if this is from a form POST.

 -+-+ Session Manager
  empty state group directories are not removed, thus alleviating
  one potential race condition.  This impacted performance
  on idle sites severely as there were now 256 directories
  to check, so made many performance enhancements to the 
  session manager.  The session manager is built to handle
  up to 20,000 client sessions over a 20 minute period.  It
  will slow the system down as it approaches this capacity.

  One such enhancement was session-ids now being 11 bytes long 
  so that its .lock file is only 16 characters in length.  
  Supposedly some file systems lookup files 16 characters or 
  less in a fast hashed lookup.  This new session-id has
  4.4 x 10^12 possible values.  I try to keep this space as
  large as possible to prevent a brute force attack.

  Another enhancement was to limit the group directories
  to 64 by only allowing the session-id prefix to be [0-3][0-f]
  instead of [0-f][0-f], checking 64 empty directories on an
  idle site takes little time for the session manager, compared
  to 256 which felt significant from the client end, especially
  on Win32 where requests are serialized.  

  If upgrading to this version, you would do well to delete
  empty StateDir group directories while your site is idle.
  Upgrading during an idle time will have a similar effect,
  as old Apache::ASP versions would delete empty directories.

 -$Application-&gt;GetSession($session_id) now creates
  an session object that only lasts until the next
  invocation of $Application-&gt;GetSession().  This is 
  to avoid opening too many file handles at once,
  where each session requires opening a lock file.

 +added experimental support for Apache::Filter 1.013 
  filter_register call

 +make test cases for $Response-&gt;Include() and 
  $Response-&gt;TrapInclude()

 +Documented CollectionItem config.

 +New $Request-&gt;QueryString(&#39;multiple args&#39;)-&gt;Count()
  interface implemented for CollectionItem config.
  Also $Request-&gt;QueryString(&#39;multiple args&#39;)-&gt;Item(1) method.
  Note ASP collections start counting at 1.

 --fixed race condition, where multiple processes might 
  try creating the same state directory at the same time, with
  one winning, and one generating an error.  Now, web process
  will recheck for directory existence and error if 
  it doesn&#39;t. 

 -global.asa compilation will be cached correctly, not
  sure when this broke.  It was getting reloaded every request.

 -StateAllWrite config, when set creates state files
  with a+rw or 0666 permissions, and state directories
  with a+rwx or 0777 permissions.  This allows web servers
  running as different users on the same machine to share a 
  common StateDir config.  Also StateGroupWrite config
  with perms 0770 and 0660 respectively.

 -Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader() now won&#39;t follow links to 
  directories when searching for scripts to load.

 +New RegisterIncludes config which is on by default only
  when using Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader(), for compiling includes
  when precompiling scripts.

 +Apache::ASP::CompileInclude path optimized, which underlies
  $Response-&gt;Include()

 +$Request-&gt;QueryString-&gt;(&#39;foo&#39;)-&gt;Item() syntax enabled
  with CollectionItem config setting.  Default syntax
  supported is $Request-&gt;QueryString(&#39;foo&#39;) which is
  in compatible.  Other syntax like $Request-&gt;{Form}{foo}
  and $Request-&gt;Form-&gt;Item(&#39;foo&#39;) will work in either case.

 +New fix suggested for missing Apache reference in 
  Apache::ASP handler startup for RedHat RPMs.  Added
  to error message.

 --Backup flock() unlocking try for QNX will not corrupt the 
  normal flock() LOCK_UN usage, after trying to unlock a file
  that doesn&#39;t exist.  This bug was uncovered from the below 
  group deletion race condition that existed. 

 -Session garbage collection will not delete new group
  directories that have just been created but are empty.
  There was a race condition where a new group directory would
  be created, but then deleted by a garbage collector before
  it could be initialized correctly with new state files.

 +Better random session-id checksums for $Session creation.
  per process srand() initialization, because srand() 
  may be called once prefork and never called again.
  Call without arguments to rely on perl&#39;s decent rand
  seeding.  Then when calling rand() in Secret() we have
  enough random data, that even if someone else calls srand()
  to something fixed, should not mess things up terribly since
  we checksum things like $$ &amp; time, as well as perl memory
  references.

 +XMLSubs installation make test.

 -Fix for multiline arguments for XMLSubs

 +Documented XMLSubsMatch &amp; XSLT* configuration

 +XSLT XSL template is now first executed as an 
  ASP script just like the XML scripts.  This is 
  just one step away now from implementing XSP logic.

 +$Server-&gt;Execute and $Server-&gt;Transfer API extensions
  implemented.  Execute is the same as $Request-&gt;Include()
  and $Server-&gt;Transfer is like an apache internal redirect
  but keeps the current ASP objects for the next script.

  Added examples, transfer.htm, and modified dynamic_includes.htm.

 +Better compile time error debugging with Debug 2 or -2.
  Will hilite/link the buggy line for global.asa errors, 
  include errors, and XML/XSLT errors just like with 
  ASP scripts before.

 +Nice source hiliting when viewing source for the example
  scripts.

 +XMLSubsMatch and XSLT* settings documented in 
  the XML/XSLT section of the site/README.

 -XMLSubsMatch will strip parens in a pattern match
  so it does not interfere with internal matching use.

 +XSLT integration allowing XML to be rendered by XSLT
  on the fly.  XSLT specifies XSL file to transform XML.
  XSLTMatch is a regexp that matches XML file names, like \.xml$,
  which will be transformed by XSLT setting, default .*
  
  XSLTCacheSize when specified uses Tie::Cache to cached XML DOMs 
  internally and cache XSLT transformations output per XML/XSL 
  combination.  XML DOM objects can take a lot of RAM, so use
  this setting judiciously like setting to 100.  Definitely 
  experiment with this value.

 +More client info in the error mail feature, including
  client IP, form data, query string, and HTTP_* client headers

 +With Time::HiRes loaded, and Debug set to non 0, 
  will add a &lt;!-- Apache::ASP served request in xx.xx seconds --&gt;
  to text/html output, similar to Cocoon, per user request  
  Will also add this to the system debug error log output
  when Debug is &lt; 0

 -bug fix on object initialization optimization earlier
  in this release, that was introduced for faster event
  handler execution.

 +Apache::ASP::Parse() takes a file name, scalar, or
  scalar ref for arguments of data to parse for greater
  integration ability with other applications.

 +PodComments optimization, small speed increase at
  compilation time.

 +String optimization on internal rendering that avoids 
  unnecessary copying of static html, by using refs.  Should 
  make a small difference on sites with large amounts of 
  static html.

 +CompressGzip setting which, when Compress::Zlib is installed,
  will compress text/html automatically going out to the web
  browser if the client supports gzip encoding.

 ++Script_OnFlush event handler, and auxiliary work optimizing
  asp events in general.  $Response-&gt;{BinaryRef} created which
  is a reference to outgoing output, which can be used 
  to modify the data at runtime before it goes out to the client. 

 +Some code optimizations that boost speed from 22 to 24 
  hits per second when using Sessions without $Application,
  on a simple hello world benchmark on a WinNT PII300.

 ++Better SessionManagement, more aware of server farms that 
  don&#39;t have reliable NFS locking.  The key here is to have only
  one process on one server in charge of session garbage collection
  at any one time, and try to create this situation with a snazzy
  CleanupMaster routine.  This is done by having a process register
  itself in the internal database with a server key created at
  apache start time.  If this key gets stale, another process can 
  become the master, and this period will not exceed the period
  SessionTimeout / StateManager.

  ** Work on session manager sponsored by LRN, <a href=http://www.lrn.com>http://www.lrn.com</a>.  **
  ** This work was used to deploy a server farm in production with  **
  ** NFS mounted StateDir. Thanks to Craig Samuel for his belief in **
  ** open source. :)                                                **

  Future work for server farm capabilities might include breaking
  up the internal database into one of 256 internal databases 
  hashed by the first 2 chars of the session id.  Also on the plate
  is Apache::Session like abilities with locking and/or data storage
  occuring in a SQL database.  The first dbs to be done will include
  MySQL &amp; Oracle.

 +Better session security which will create a new session id for an 
  incoming session id that does not match one already seen.  This will
  help for those with Search engines that have bookmarked
  pages with the session ids in the query strings.  This breaks away
  from standard ASP session id implementation which will automatically
  use the session id presented by the browser, now a new session id will
  be returned if the presented one is invalid or expired.

 -$Application-&gt;GetSession will only return a session if
  one already existed.  It would create one before by default.

 +Script_OnFlush global.asa event handler, and $Response-&gt;{BinaryRef}
  member which is a scalar reference to the content about to be flushed.
  See <a href=eg/global.asa>./site/eg/global.asa</a> for example usage, used in this case to
  insert font tags on the fly into the output.

 +Highlighting and linking of line error when Debug is set to 2 or -2.

 --removed fork() call from flock() backup routine? How did 
   that get in there?  Oh right, testing on Win32. :(
   Very painful lesson this one, sorry to whom it may concern.

 +$Application-&gt;SessionCount support turned off by default
  must enable with SessionCount config option.  This feature
  puts an unnecessary load on busy sites, so not default 
  behavior now.  

 ++XMLSubsMatch setting that allows the developer to 
  create custom tags XML style that execute perl subroutines.
  See <a href=eg/xml_subs.asp>./site/eg/xml_subs.asp</a>

 +MailFrom config option that defaults the From: field for 
  mails sent via the Mail* configs and $Server-&gt;Mail()

 +$Server-&gt;Mail(\%mail, %smtp_args) API extension

 +MailErrorsTo &amp; MailAlertTo now can take comma
  separated email addresses for multiple recipients.

 -tracking of subroutines defined in scripts and includes so 
  StatINC won&#39;t undefine them when reloading the GlobalPackage, 
  and so an warning will be logged when another script redefines 
  the same subroutine name, which has been the bane of at least
  a few developers.

 -Loader() will now recompile dynamic includes that 
  have changed, even if main including script has not.
  This is useful if you are using Loader() in a 
  PerlRestartHandler, for reloading scripts when
  gracefully restarting apache.

 -Apache::ASP used to always set the status to 200 by 
  default explicitly with $r-&gt;status().  This would be 
  a problem if a script was being used to as a 404 
  ErrorDocument, because it would always return a 200 error
  code, which is just wrong.  $Response-&gt;{Status} is now 
  undefined by default and will only be used if set by 
  the developer.  

  Note that by default a script will still return a 200 status, 
  but $Response-&gt;{Status} may be used to override this behavior.

 +$Server-&gt;Config($setting) API extension that allows developer
  to access config settings like Global, StateDir, etc., and is a 
  wrapper around Apache-&gt;dir_config($setting)

 +Loader() will log the number of scripts
  recompiled and the number of scripts checked, instead
  of just the number of scripts recompiled, which is
  misleading as it reports 0 for child httpds after
  a parent fork that used Loader() upon startup.  	

 -Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader() would have a bad error if it didn&#39;t load 
  any scripts when given a directory, prints &quot;loaded 0 scripts&quot; now

 +Documented SessionQuery* &amp; $Server-&gt;URL() and 
  cleaned up formatting some, as well as redoing
  some of the sections ordering for better readability.
  Document the cookieless session functionality more
  in a new SESSIONS section.  Also documented new 
  FileUpload configs and $Request-&gt;FileUpload collection.
  Documented StatScripts.

 +StatScripts setting which if set to 0 will not reload
  includes, global.asa, or scripts when changed.

 +FileUpload file handles cleanup at garbage collection
  time so developer does not have to worry about lazy coding
  and undeffing filehandles used in code.  Also set 
  uploaded filehandles to binmode automatically on Win32 
  platforms, saving the developer yet more typing.

 +FileUploadTemp setting, default 0, if set will leave
  a temp file on disk during the request, which may be 
  helpful for processing by other programs, but is also
  a security risk in that others could potentially read 
  this file while the script is running. 

  The path to the temp file will be available at
  $Request-&gt;{FileUpload}{$form_field}{TempFile}.
  The regular use of file uploads remains the same
  with the &lt;$filehandle&gt; to the upload at 
  $Request-&gt;{Form}{$form_field}.

 +FileUploadMax setting, default 0, currently an 
  alias for $CGI::POST_MAX, which determines the 
  max size for a file upload in bytes.  

 +SessionQueryParse only auto parses session-ids
  into links when a session-id COOKIE is NOT found.
  This feature is only enabled then when a user has
  disabled cookies, so the runtime penalty of this
  feature won&#39;t drag down the whole site, since most
  users will have cookies turned on.   

 -StatINC &amp; StatINCMatch will not undef Fnctl.pm flock 
  functions constants like O_RDWR, because the code references
  are not well trackable.  This would result in sporadic 500 server
  errors when a changed module was reloaded that imported O_* flock 
  functions from Fnctl.

 +SessionQueryParse &amp; SessionQueryParseMatch
  settings that enable auto parsing session ids into 
  URLs for cookieless sessions.  Will pick up URLs in 
  &lt;a href&gt;, &lt;area href&gt;, &lt;form action&gt;, &lt;frame src&gt;,
  &lt;iframe src&gt;, &lt;img src&gt;, &lt;input src&gt;, &lt;link href&gt;
  $Response-&gt;Redirect($URL) and the first URL in 
  script tags like &lt;script&gt;*.location.href=$URL&lt;/script&gt;

  These settings require that buffering be enabled, as
  Apache::ASP will parse through the buffer to parse the URLs.

  With SessionQueryParse on, it will just parse non-absolute
  URLs, but with SessionQueryParseMatch set to some server
  url regexp, like ^<tt>http://localhost</tt> , will also parse
  in the session id for URLs that match that.

  When testing, the performance hit from this parsing
  a script dropped from 12.5 hits/sec on my WinNT box
  to 11.7 hits per second for 1K of buffered output.
  The difference is .007 of my PII300&#39;s processing power
  per second.

  For 10K of output then, my guess is that this speed
  of script, would be slowed to 6.8 hits per second.
  This kind of performance hit would also slow a
  script running at 40 hits per second on a UNIX box
  to 31 hits/sec for 1K, and to 11 hits/sec for 10K parsed.

  Your mileage may vary and you will have to test the difference
  yourself.  Get yourself a valid URL with a session-id in
  it, and run it through ab, or Socrates, with SessionQuery
  turned on, and then with SessionQueryParse set to see 
  the difference.  SessionQuery just enables of session id
  setting from the query string but will not auto parse urls.

 -If buffering, Content-Length will again be set.
  It broke, probably while I was tuning in the past 
  couple versions.

 +UseStrict setting compiles all scripts including
  global.asa with &quot;use strict&quot; turned on for catching
  more coding errors.  With this setting enabled,
  use strict errors die during compilation forcing
  Apache::ASP to try to recompile the script until
  successful.

 -Object use in includes like $Response-&gt;Write() 
  no longer error with &quot;use strict&quot; programming.  

 +SessionQuery config setting with $Server-&gt;URL($url, { %params } ) 
  alpha API extensions to enable cookieless sessions.

 +Debugging not longer produces internal debugging
  by default.  Set to -1,-2 for internal debugging
  for Debug settings 1 &amp; 2.

 +Both StateSerializer &amp; StateDB can be changed 
  without affecting a live web site, by storing 
  the configurations for $Application &amp; $Session 
  in an internal database, so that if $Session was
  created with SDBM_File for the StateDB (default),
  it will keep this StateDB setting until it ends.

 +StateSerializer config setting.  Default Data::Dumper,
  can also be set to Storable.  Controls how data is
  serialized before writing to $Application &amp; $Session.

 +Beefed up the make test suite.

 +Improved the locking, streamlining a bit of the 
  $Application / $Session setup process.  Bench is up to 
  22 from 21 hits / sec on dev NT box.

 +Cut more fat for faster startup, now on my dev box 
  I get 44 hits per sec Apache::ASP vs. 48 Embperl 
  vs. 52 CGI via Apache::Registry for the HelloWorld Scripts.

 -Improved linking for the online site documentation, 
  where a few links before were bad.

	51 hits per sec for CGI Apache::Registry scripts  

  Before Apache::ASP was clocking some 31 hits per sec.
  Apache::ASP also went from 75 to 102 hits per second 
  on Solaris.

 +PerlTaintCheck On friendly.  This is mod_perl&#39;s way 
  of providing -T taint checking.  When Apache::ASP
  is used with state objects like $Session or $Application,
  MLDBM must also be made taint friendly with:

    $MLDBM::RemoveTaint = 1;

  which could be put in the global.asa.  Documented.

 +Added $Response-&gt;ErrorDocument($error_code, $uri_or_string) 
  API extension which allows for setting of Apache&#39;s error
  document at runtime.  This is really just a wrapper 
  for Apache-&gt;custom_response() renamed so it syncs with
  the Apache ErrorDocument config setting.  Updated
  documentation, and added error_document.htm example.

 =OrderCollections setting was added, but then REMOVED
  because it was not going to be used.  It bound 
  $Request-&gt;* collections/hashes to Tie::IxHash, so that data
  in those collections would be read in the order the 
  browser sent it, when eaching through or with keys.

 -global.asa will be reloaded when changed.  This broke
  when I optimized the modification times with (stat($file))[9]
  rather than &quot;use File::stat; stat($file)-&gt;mtime&quot;

 -Make Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader() PerlRestartHandler safe,
  had some unstrict code that was doing the wrong thing.

 -IncludesDir config now works with DynamicIncludes.

 +DebugBufferLength feature added, giving control to 
  how much buffered output gets shown when debugging errors.

 ++Tuning of $Response-&gt;Write(), which processes all
  static html internally, to be almost 50% faster for
  its typical use, when BufferingOn is enabled, and 
  CgiHeaders are disabled, both being defaults.

  This can show significant speed improvements for tight
  loops that render ASP output.

 +Auto linking of ./site/eg/ text to example scripts
  at web site.

 +$Application-&gt;GetSession($session_id) API extension, useful
  for managing active user sessions when storing session ids
  in $Application.  Documented.

 -disable use of flock() on Win95/98 where it is unimplemented

 <b>&#045;&#064;&#097;&#114;&#114;&#097;&#121;</b> context of $Request-&gt;Form(&#39;name&#39;) returns
  undef when value for &#39;name&#39; is undefined.  Put extra
  logic in there to make sure this happens.

 -$Response-&gt;{Buffer} and PerlSetVar BufferingOn
  configs now work when set to 0, to unbuffer output,
  and send it out to the web client as the script generates it.

  Buffering is enabled by default, as it is faster, and
  allows a script to error cleanly in the middle of execution.  

 +more bullet proof loading of Apache::Symbol, changed the 
  way Apache::ASP loads modules in general.  It used to 
  check for the module to load every time, if it hadn&#39;t loaded
  successfully before, but now it just tries once per httpd,
  so the web server will have to be restarted to see new installed
  modules.  This is just for modules that Apache::ASP relies on.

  Old modules that are changed or updated with an installation
  are still reloaded with the StatINC settings if so configured. 

 +ASP web site wraps &lt;font face=&quot;courier new&quot;&gt; around &lt;pre&gt;
  tags now to override the other font used for the text
  areas.  The spacing was all weird in Netscape before
  for &lt;pre&gt; sections.

 -Fixed Content-Length calculation when using the Clean
  option, so that the length is calculated after the HTML
  is clean, not before.  This would cause a browser to 
  hang sometimes.

 +Added IncludesDir config option that if set will also be
  used to check for includes, so that includes may easily be
  shared between applications.  By default only Global and 
  the directory the script is in are checked for includes.

  Also added IncludesDir as a possible configuration option
  for Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader()

 -Re-enabled the Application_OnStart &amp; OnEnd events, after
  breaking them when implementing the AllowApplicationState
  config setting.

 +Better pre-fork caching ... StatINC &amp; StatINCMatch are now 
  args for Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader(), so StatINC symbols loading
  may be done pre-fork and shared between httpds.  This lowers
  the child httpd init cost of StatINC.  Documented.

 +Made Apache::ASP Basic Authorization friendly so authentication
  can be handled by ASP scripts.  If AuthName and AuthType Apache
  config directives are set, and a $Response-&gt;{Status} is set to 
  401, a user will be prompted for username/password authentication
  and the entered data will show up in ServerVariables as:
    $env = $Request-&gt;ServerVariables
    $env-&gt;{REMOTE_USER} = $env-&gt;{AUTH_USER} = username
    $env-&gt;{AUTH_PASSWD} = password
    $env-&gt;{AUTH_NAME}   = your realm
    $env-&gt;{AUTH_TYPE}   = &#39;Basic&#39;

  This is the same place to find auth data as if Apache had some 
  authentication handler deal with the auth phase separately.

 -MailErrorsTo should report the right file now that generates
  the error.

<font face="courier new" size=3><pre>
 --State databases like $Session, $Application are 
  now tied/untied to every lock/unlock triggered by read/write 
  access.  This was necessary for correctness issues, so that 
  database file handles are flushed appropriately between writes
  in a highly concurrent multi-process environment.

  This problem raised its ugly head because under high volume, 
  a DB_File can become corrupt if not flushed correctly.  
  Unfortunately, there is no way to flush SDBM_Files &amp; DB_Files 
  consistently other than to tie/untie the databases every access.

  DB_File may be used optionally for StateDB, but the default is
  to use SDBM_File which is much faster, but limited to 1024 byte
  key/value pairs.

  For SDBM_Files before, if there were too many concurrent 
  writes to a shared database like $Application, some of the 
  writes would not be saved because another process
  might overwrite the changes with its own.

  There is now a 10 fold performance DECREASE associated
  with reading from and writing to files like $Session 
  and $Application.  With rough benchmarks I can get about
  100 increments (++) now per second to $Session-&gt;{count}, where
  before I could get 1000 increments / second.  

  You can improve this if you have many reads / writes happening
  at the same time, by placing locking code around the group like
  
	$Session-&gt;Lock();
	$Session-&gt;{count}++;
	$Session-&gt;{count}++;
	$Session-&gt;{count}++;
	$Session-&gt;UnLock();	

  This method will reduce the number of ties to the $Session database
  from 6 to 1 for this kind of code, and will improve the performance
  dramatically.

  Also, instead of using explicit $Session locking, you can 
  create an automatic lock on $Session per script by setting
  SessionSerialize in your config to 1.  The danger here is
  if you have any long running scripts, the user will have
  to wait for it to finish before another script can be run.

  To see the number of lock/unlocks or ties/unties to each database
  during a script execution, look at the last lines of debug output
  to your error log when Debug is set to 1.  This can help you
  performance tweak access to these databases.

 +Updated documentation with new config settings and
  API extensions.

 +Added AllowApplicationState config option which allows
  you to leave $Application undefined, and will not
  execute Application_OnStart or Application_OnEnd.
  This can be a slight performance increase of 2-3% if
  you are not using $Application, but are using $Session.

 +Added $Session-&gt;Lock() / $Session-&gt;UnLock() API routines
  necessary additions since access to session is not
  serialized by default like IIS ASP.  Also prompted
  by change in locking code which retied to SDBM_File
  or DB_File each lock.  If you $Session-&gt;Lock / UnLock
  around many read/writes, you will increase performance.

 +Added StateCache config which, if set will cache
  the file handle locks for $Application and an internal 
  database used for tracking $Session info.  This caching can 
  make an ASP application perform up to 10% faster,
  at a cost of each web server process holding 2 more 
  cached file handles open, per ASP application using
  this configuration.  The data written to or read from
  these state databases is not cached, just the locking 
  file handles are held open.

 -Added in much more locking in session manager 
  and session garbage collector to help avoid collisions
  between the two.  There were definite windows that the
  two would collide in, during which bad things could 
  happen on a high volume site.

 -Fixed some warnings in DESTROY and ParseParams()

 -CGI &amp; StatINC or StatINCMatch would have bad results
  at times, with StatINC deleting dynamically compiled
  CGI subroutines, that were imported into other scripts
  and modules namespaces.

  A couple tweaks, and now StatINC &amp; CGI play nice again ;)
  StatINCMatch should be safe to use in production with CGI. 
  This affects in particular environments that use file upload, 
  since CGI is loaded automatically by Apache::ASP to handle 
  file uploads.

  This fix should also affect other seemingly random 
  times when StatINC or StatINCMatch don&#39;t seem to do 
  the right thing.

 +use of ASP objects like $Response are now &quot;use strict&quot;
  safe in scripts, while UniquePackages config is set.

 +Better handling of &quot;use strict&quot; errors in ASP scripts.
  The error is detected, and the developer is pointed to the 
  Apache error log for the exact error.  

  The script with &quot;use strict&quot; errors will be recompiled again.  Its seems 
  though that &quot;use strict&quot; will only throw its error once, so that a script 
  can be recompiled with the same errors, and work w/o any use strict
  error messaging.

 -Compiles are now 10 +times faster for scripts with lots of big
  embedded perl blocks &lt;% #perl %&gt;

  Compiles were slow because of an old PerlScript compatibility
  parsing trick where $Request-&gt;QueryString(&#39;hi&#39;)-&gt;{item}
  would be parsed to $Request-&gt;QueryString(&#39;hi&#39;) which works.
  I think the regexp that I was using had O(n^2) characteristics
  and it took a really big perl block to 10 +seconds to parse
  to understand there was a problem :(

  I doubt anyone needed this compatibility, I don&#39;t even see
  any code that looks like this in the online PerlScript examples,
  so I&#39;ve commented out this parsing trick for now.  If you 
  need me to bring back this functionality, it will be in the 
  form of a config setting.

  For information on PerlScript compatibility, see the PerlScript
  section in the ASP docs.

 -Added UniquePackages config option, that if set brings back 
  the old method of compiling each ASP script into its own
  separate package.  As of v.10, scripts are compiled by default
  into the same package, so that scripts, dynamic includes &amp; global.asa
  can share globals.  This BROKE scripts in the same ASP Application
  that defined the same sub routines, as their subs would redefine
  each other.  

  UniquePackages has scripts compiled into separate perl packages,
  so they may define subs with the same name, w/o fear of overlap.
  Under this settings, scripts will not be able to share globals.  

 -Secure field for cookies in $Response-&gt;Cookies() must be TRUE to 
  force cookie to be secure.  Before, it just had to be defined, 
  which gave wrong behavior for Secure =&gt; 0. 

 +$Response-&gt;{IsClientConnected} set to one by default.  Will
  work out a real value when I upgrade to apache 1.3.6.  This
  value has no meaning before, as apache aborts the perl code
  when a client drops its connection in earlier versions.

 +better compile time debugging of dynamic includes, with 
  Debug 2 setting

 +&quot;use strict&quot; friendly handling of compiling dynamic includes
  with errors

 +Lots of documentation updates

 +The MailHost config option is the smtp server used for 
  relay emails for the Mail* config options.

 +MailAlertTo config option used for sending a short administrative
  alert for an internal ASP error, server code 500.  This is the 
  compliment to MailErrorsTo, but is suited for sending a to a
  small text based pager.  The email sent by MailErrorsTo would
  then be checked by the web admin for quick response &amp; debugging
  for the incident. 

  The MailAlertPeriod config specifies the time in minutes during 
  which only one alert will be sent, which defaults to 20.

 +MailErrorsTo config options sends the results of a 500 error
  to the email address specified as if Debug were set to 2.
  If Debug 2 is set, this config will not be on, as it is
  for production use only.  Debug settings less than 2 only 
  log errors to the apache server error log.

 -StatINCMatch / StatINC can be used in production and work
  even after a server graceful restart, which is essential for 
  a production server.

 -Content-Length header is set again, if BufferingOn is set, and
  haven&#39;t $Response-&gt;Flush()&#39;d.  This broke when I introduce
  the Script_OnEnd event handler.

 +Optimized reloading of the GlobalPackage perl module upon changes, 
  so that scripts and dynamic includes don&#39;t have to be recompiled.  
  The global.asa will still have to be though.  Since we started
  compiling all routines into a package that can be named with
  GlobalPackage, we&#39;ve been undeffing compiled scripts and includes
  when the real GlobalPackage changed on disk, as we do a full sweep
  through the namespace.  Now, we skip those subs that we know to 
  be includes or scripts. 

 -Using Apache::Symbol::undef() to undefine precompiled scripts
  and includes when reloading those scripts.  Doing just an undef() 
  would sometimes result in an &quot;active subroutine undef&quot; error.
  This bug came out when I started thrashing the StatINC system
  for production use.

 +StatINCMatch setting created for production use reloading of
  perl modules.  StatINCMatch allows StatINC reloading of a
  subset of all the modules defined in %INC, those that match
  $module =~ /$StatINCMatch/, where module is some module name
  like Class/Struct.pm

 +Reoptimized pod comment parsing.  I slowed it down to sync
  lines numbers in the last version, but found another corner I could cut.

 += improvement; - = bug fix

 +Added index.html file to ./eg to help people wade through
  the examples.  This one has been long overdue.

 +Clean config option, or setting $Response-&gt;{Clean} to 1 - 9,
  uses HTML::Clean to compress text/html output of ASP scripts.
  I like the Clean 1 setting which is lightweight, stripping 
  white space for about 10% compression, at a cost of less than
  a 5% performance penalty.

 +Using pod style commenting no longer confuses the line
  numbering.  ASP script line numbers are almost exactly match
  their compiled perl version, except that normal inline includes
  (not dynamic) insert extra text which can confuse line numbering.
  If you want perl error line numbers to entirely sync with your 
  ASP scripts, I would suggest learning how to use dynamic includes,
  as opposed to inline includes.

 -Wrapped StatINC reloading of libs in an eval, and capturing
  error for Debug 2 setting.  This makes changing libs with StatINC
  on a little more friendly when there are errors. 

 -$Request-&gt;QueryString() now stores multiple values for the 
  same key, just as $Request-&gt;Form() has since v.07.  In
  wantarray() context like @vals = $Request-&gt;QueryString(&#39;dupkey&#39;),
  @vals will store whatever values where associated with dupkey
  in the query string like (1,2) from: ?dupkey=1&amp;dupkey=2

 +The GlobalPackage config directive may be defined
  to explicitly set the perl module that all scripts and global.asa
  are compiled into.

 -Dynamic includes may be in the Global directory, just like
  normal includes.

 +Perl script generated from asp scripts should match line
  for line, seen in errors, except when using inline (default) 
  includes, pod comments, or &lt;% #comment %&gt; perl comments, which 
  will throw off the line counts by adding text, removing
  text, or having an extra newline added, respectively.

 -Script_OnEnd may now send output to the browser.  Before
  $main::Response-&gt;End() was being called at the end of the
  main script preventing further output.
</pre></font>++All scripts are compiled as routines in a namespace uniquely
<font face="courier new" size=3><pre>  defined by the global.asa of the ASP application.  Thus,
  scripts, includes, and global.asa routines will share
  all globals defined in the global.asa namespace.   This means
  that globals between scripts will be shared, and globals
  defined in a global.asa will be available to scripts.

  Scripts used to have their own namespace, thus globals
  were not shared between them.

 +a -o $output_dir switch on the ./cgi/asp script allows
  it to execute scripts and write their output to an output
  directory.  Useful for building static html sites, based on
  asp scripts.  An example use would be:

    asp -b -o out *.asp

  Without an output directory, script output is written to STDOUT

 +Improved docs on $Response-&gt;Cookies() and $Request-&gt;Cookies()

 +Added PERFORMANCE doc to main README, and added sub section
  on precompiling scripts with Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader()

 +Naming of CompileIncludes switched over to DynamicIncludes 
  for greater clarity.

 +Dynamic includes can now reference ASP objects like $Session
  w/o the $main::* syntax.  These subs are no longer anonymous
  subs, and are now compiled into the namespace of the global.asa package.

 +Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader() precompiles dynamic includes too. Making this work
  required fixing some subtle bugs / dependencies in the compiling process.

 +Added Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader() similar to Apache::RegistryLoader for
  precompiling ASP scripts.  Precompile a whole site at server 
  startup with one function call.

 +Prettied the error messaging with Debug 2.

 +$Response-&gt;Debug(@args) debugging extension, which
  allows a developer to hook into the module&#39;s debugging,
  and only have @args be written to error_log when Debug is greater
  than 0.

 -Put write locking code around State writes, like $Session
  and $Application.  I thought I fixed this bug a while ago.

 -API change: converted $Session-&gt;Timeout() and $Session-&gt;SessionID() 
  methods into $Session-&gt;{Timeout} and $Session-&gt;{SessionID} properties.
  The use of these properties as methods is deprecated, but 
  backwards compatibility will remain.  Updated ./eg/session.asp
  to use these new properties.

 +Implemented $Response-&gt;{PICS} which if set sends out a PICS-Label
  HTTP header, useful for ratings.

 +Implemented $Response-&gt;{CacheControl} and $Response-&gt;{Charset} members.
  By default, CacheControl is &#39;private&#39;, and this value gets sent out
  every request as HTTP header Cache-Control.  Charset appends itself
  onto the content type header.

 +Implemented $Request-&gt;BinaryRead(), $Request-&gt;{TotalBytes},
  documented them, and updated ./eg/form.asp for an example usage. 

 +Implemented $Response-&gt;BinaryWrite(), documented, and created
  and example in ./eg/binary_write.htm

 +Implemented $Server-&gt;MapPath() and created example of its use
  in ./eg/server.htm

 -$Request-&gt;Form() now reads file uploads correctly with 
  the latest CGI.pm, where $Request-&gt;Form(&#39;file_field&#39;) returns
  the actual file name uploaded, which can be used as a file handle
  to read in the data.  Before, $Request-&gt;Form(&#39;file_field&#39;) would
  return a glob that looks like *Fh::filename, so to get the file
  name, you would have to parse it like =~ s/^\*Fh\:\://,
  which you no longer have to do.  As long as parsing was done as
  mentioned, the change should be backwards compatible.

 +Updated  +enhanced documentation on file uploads.  Created extra
  comments about it as an FAQ, and under $Response-&gt;Form(), the latter
  being an obvious place for a developer to look for it.

 +Updated ./eg/file_upload.asp to show use of non file form data, 
  with which we had a bug before.

 +Finished retieing *STDIN to cached STDIN contents, so that 
  CGI input routines may be used transparently, along side with
  use of $Request-&gt;Form()

 +Cleaned up and optimized $Request code

 +Updated documentation for CGI input &amp; file uploads.  Created
  file upload FAQ.

 +Reworked ./eg/cgi.htm example to use CGI input routines
  after doing a native read of STDIN.

 ++Added dynamic includes with &lt;!--include file=file args=@args--&gt;
  extension.  This style of include is compiled as an anonymous sub &amp; 
  cached, and then executed with @args passed to the subroutine for 
  execution.  This is include may also be rewritten as a new API 
  extension: $Response-&gt;Include(&#39;file&#39;, @args)

 +Added ./eg/compiled_includes.htm example documenting new dynamic includes.

 +Documented SSI: native file includes, and the rest with filtering 
  to Apache::SSI

 +Turned the documentation of Filter config to value of Off so 
  people won&#39;t cut and paste the On config by default.

 +Added SecureSession config option, which forces session cookie to 
  be sent only under https secured www page requests.

 +Added StateDB config option allows use of DB_File for $Session, since 
  default use of SDBM_File is limited.  See StateDB in README.

 +file include syntax w/o quotes supported like &lt;!--#include file=test.inc--&gt;

 +Nested includes are supported, with includes including each other.
  Recursive includes are detected and errors out when an include has been 
  included 100 times for a script.  Better to quit early than 
  have a process spin out of control. (PORTABLE ? probably not)

 +Allow &lt;!--include file=file.inc--&gt; notation w/o quotes around file names

 -PerlSetEnv apache conf setting now get passed through to 
  $Request-&gt;ServerVariables. This update has ServerVariables 
  getting data from %ENV instead of $r-&gt;cgi_env

 +StateManager config directive.  StateManager specifies how frequently
  Sessions are cleaned up, with 10 (default) meaning that old Sessions
  will be cleaned up 10 times per SessionTimeout period (default 20 minutes).

 +$Application-&gt;SessionCount() implemented, non-portable method.

  in Apache&#39;s $r-&gt;register_cleanup.  Works well supposedly.

 +PerlScript compatibility work, trying to make ports smoother.
	: Collection emulator, no -&gt;{Count} property
	: $.*(.*)-&gt;{Item} parsed automatically, 
	  shedding the -&gt;{Item} for Collection support (? better way ?)
	: No VBScript dates support, just HTTP RFC dates with HTTP::Date
	: Win32::OLE::in not supported, just use &quot;keys %{$Collection}&quot;	

 +./cgi/asp script for testing scripts from the command line
	: will be upgraded to CGI method of doing asp
	: is not &quot;correct&quot; in anyway, so not documented for now
	  but still useful

 +strips DOS carriage returns from scripts automatically, so that
  programs like FrontPage can upload pages to UNIX servers
  without perl choking on the extra \r characters.

 +Added PERFORMANCE doc, which includes benchmarks  +hints.

 +Better installation warnings and errors for other modules required. 

 -Turned off StatINC in eg/.htaccess, as not everyone installs Devel::Symdump

 -Fixed AUTOLOAD state bug, which wouldn&#39;t let you each through state
  objects, like %{$Session}, or each %$Session, (bug introduced in v.04)

 +Parses ASP white space better.  HTML output matches author&#39;s intent
  by better dealing with white space surrounding &lt;% perl blocks %&gt;

 -Scalar insertion code &lt;%=$foo%&gt; can now span many lines.

 +Added include.t test script for includes.

 +Script recompiles when included files change.

 +Files can be included in script with 
  SSI &lt;!--#include file=&quot;filename&quot;--&gt; syntax, needs to be
  done in ASP module to allow compilation of included code and html 
  into script.  Future chaining with Apache::SSI will allow static 
  html includes, and other SSI directives

 +Example script eg/cgi.htm demonstrating CGI.pm use for output.

 +Optimized ASP parsing, faster and more legible executing code
	: try &#39;die();&#39; in code with setting PerlSetVar Debug 2

 +Cleaned up code for running with &#39;use strict&#39;

 -Fixed directory handle leak on Solaris, from not closing after opendir()

 +StatINC overhaul.  StatINC setting now works as it should, with 
  the caveat that exported functions will not be refreshed.

 +NoState setting optimization, disallows $Application &amp; $Session

 +$Application-&gt;*Lock() functions implemented

 -SoftRedirect setting for those who want scripts to keep running
  after a Redirect()

 +SessionSerialize setting to lock session while script is running
	: Microsoft ASP style session locking
	: For a session, scripts execute one at a time 
	: NOT recommended use, please see note.

 -MLDBM can be used for other things without messing up internal use
	: before if it was used with different DB&#39;s and serializers,
	  internal state could be lost.

 --State file locking.  Corruption worries, and loss of data no more.

 +CGI header support, developer can use CGI.pm for *output*, or just print()
	: print &quot;Set-Cookie: test=cookie\n&quot;, and things will just work
	: use CGI.pm for output
	: utilizes $r-&gt;send_cgi_header(), thanks Doug!

 +Improved Cookie implementation, more flexible and complete
	- Domain cookie key now works
	: Expire times now taken from time(), and relative time in sec
	: Request-&gt;Cookies() reading more flexible, with wantarray()
	  on hash cookie values, %hash = $Request-&gt;Cookie(&#39;test&#39;);

 -make test module naming correction, was t.pm, now T.pm for Unix

 +POD / README cleanup, formatting and HTML friendly.

 +Installation &#39;make test&#39; now works

 +ActiveX objects on Win32 implemented with $Server-&gt;CreateObject() 

 +Cookies implemented: $Response-&gt;Cookies() &amp; $Request-&gt;Cookies()

 -Fixed $Response object API, converting some methods to object members.
  Deprecated methods, but backwards compatible.

 +Improved error messaging, debug output

 +$, influences $Response-&gt;Write(@strings) behavior

 +perl print() works, sending output to $Response object

 +$Response-&gt;Write() prints scalars, arrays, and hashes.  Before only scalars.

 +Begin implementation of $Server object.

 +Implemented $Response-&gt;{Expires} and $Response-&gt;{ExpiresAbsolute}

 +Added &quot;PerlSetVar StatINC&quot; config option

 +$0 is aliased to current script filename

 +ASP Objects ($Response, etc.) are set in main package
  Thus notation like $main::Response-&gt;Write() can be used anywhere.

 ++Session Manager, won&#39;t break under denial of service attack

 +Fleshed out $Response, $Session objects, almost full implementation.

 +Enormously more documentation.

 -Fixed error handling with Debug = 2.

 -Documentation fixed for pod2man support.  README now more man-like.

 -Stripped \r\n dos characters from installation files

 -755 mode set for session state directory when created

 -Loads Win32/OLE properly, won&#39;t break with UNIX

 Syntax Support
 --------------
 Initial release, could be considered alpha software.
 Allows developers to embed perl in html ASP style.

 &lt;!-- sample here --&gt;
 &lt;html&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
 &lt;% for(1..10) { %&gt;
 	counting: &lt;%=$_%&gt; &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;% } %&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/html&gt;

 ASP Objects
 -----------
 $Session, $Application, $Response, $Request objects available
 for use in asp pages.

 $Session &amp; $Application data is preserved using SDBM files.

 $Session id&#39;s are tracked through the use of cookies.

 Security
 --------
 Timeouts any attempt to use a session id that doesn&#39;t already 
 exist.  Should stop hackers, since there is no wire speed guessing
 cookies.
