<h2>Introduction to Apache::ASP</h2>

<h3>By: Joshua Chamas</h3>

<p>

I was first drawn to Active Server Pages (ASP) as a web development
platform a couple years ago when researching how to best develop the 
<font size=-1><a href=http://www.nodeworks.com>NODEWORKS</a></font> web site.  I needed 
something maintainable, powerful, fast, portable, and of course perl.
<p>
Microsoft had developed the ASP standard as the end all to web
application development, which promised to be maintainable, powerful,
and fast.  But support for perl under PerlScript was shoddy, VBScript, 
ASP's native tongue, seemed a pathetic alternative, and an NT/IIS solution lacks a certain 
portability.  Thus I was led to developing <a href=http://www.apache-asp.org>Apache::ASP</a>, 
which runs under Doug MacEachern's <a href=http://perl.apache.org>mod_perl</a> 
for <a href=http://www.apache.org>Apache</a>.

<h3>Maintainable</h3>

I had been doing CGI style web applications for a couple of years already, 
and had never been quite satisfied with the CGI programming, 
growing less so as the HTML I was working with became increasingly more 
complex than the CGI it was embedded in.  The idea of embedding the scripting 
within the flow of the HTML seemed like a more natural fit over time.
This natural flow speaks to the heart of <b>maintainability</b>,
where another developer can pick up your code and get a feel for
it on the first read.
<p>
Check out the difference in how it feels to embed the HTML
in the scripting, versus embedding the scripting in the HTML.
A reasonably complex table, which is structurally HTML heavy,
only touches the tip of the iceberg:
<p>
<table border=2 bgcolor=blue>
<tr><td>
        <table border=4 bgcolor=white>
        
            <tr><td>SOME</td></tr>
            
            <tr><td>DATA</td></tr>
             
                </table><td><table border=4 bgcolor=white>
                
            <tr><td>TO</td></tr>
            
            <tr><td>LOOP</td></tr>
             
                </table><td><table border=4 bgcolor=white>
                
            <tr><td>OVER</td></tr>
            
            <tr><td>:)</td></tr>
            
        </table>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Coding this table in CGI, you might get:
<pre>
<hr width=90% size=1>
use CGI qw/:standard *table/;
my(@data) = (&#39;Some&#39;, &#39;Data&#39;, &#39;To&#39;, &#39;Loop&#39;, &#39;Over&#39;, &#39;:)&#39;);
print 
  header,
  start_html(&#39;Example&#39;),
  start_table({-border=&gt;2, -bgcolor=&gt;&#39;blue&#39;}),
  Tr,td,
  start_table({-border=&gt;4, -bgcolor=&gt;&#39;white&#39;})
  ;

# pretend we are reading from database cursor, so code
# would be written like so
my($data, $count);
while(@data) { 
    if($data and $count++ % 2) {
	print end_table,td,start_table({-border=&gt;4, -bgcolor=&gt;&#39;white&#39;});
    }
    $data = shift @data;
    print Tr({align=&gt;CENTER},
	     [td([uc($data).&quot;\n&quot;])]
	    )
      ;
}

print 
  end_table,
  end_table,
  end_html
  ;

<hr width=90% size=1>
</pre>
When designing the above table ASP style, a much more 
natural flow to the script takes form, wherein the developer 
can literally see the table in table layout of the page:
<pre>
<hr width=90% size=1>
&lt;% my(@data) = (&#39;Some&#39;, &#39;Data&#39;, &#39;To&#39;, &#39;Loop&#39;, &#39;Over&#39;, &#39;:)&#39;); %&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Example&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;table border=2 bgcolor=blue&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
	&lt;table border=4 bgcolor=white&gt;
	&lt;%
	my($data, $count);
	while(@data) { 
	    if($data and $count++ % 2) {
		%&gt; 
		&lt;/table&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table border=4 bgcolor=white&gt;
		&lt;% 
	    } 
	    $data = shift @data;
	    %&gt;
	    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;%=uc $data%&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
	    &lt;%
	}
	%&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

<hr width=90% size=1>
</pre>
<p>
Doesn't the HTML-centric ASP read better?  You'll see that
this becomes more true as the html of your site becomes increasingly
complex.
<p>
There are other aspects to <b>maintainability</b>, like who will
be taking over your code in 2 years. With perl CGI, you can
assume that any perl developer that you work with is going 
to be able to get through the mess you've made.  But so too
with ASP, because of the marketing muscle that Microsoft put
behind its brainchild, you can expect to get plenty of ASP 
experience in the workforce, with a huge peer learning environment.
<p>
So far, this may sound religious to some, as project design and 
maintainability take on some very fuzzy and personal characteristics, with many 
varying perspectives, but it should be at the forefront of one's mind
when beginning any software project. This leads me to the graphics designer 
you may end up working with, who doesn't know that the dynamic web site you 
are building really falls under software development ;) ... 
<p>
Because ASP is scripting embedded in HTML, you can give the graphics 
designer a few easy function calls to embed, and s/he can take the 
rest from there, using her/his favorite GUI tools to craft the web site 
beautifully.  Notice that you significantly increased the number of 
people that can work on your site by using an embedded scripting web 
application environment like ASP, versus going with a pure 
scripted CGI solution.
<p>
Another feature furthering maintainability is ASP's built-in support
for Server Side Includes (SSI), which allows the developer to 
segment common parts of the site into <b>modular</b> include files.  Thus is becomes
easy to decompose a basic site template like:
<pre>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Company Name&gt;&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;!-- main body of page here --&gt;
Copyright / Disclaimer
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>

and separate a common header and footer that can be reused 
across every script:

<pre>
[header.inc]
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Company Name&gt;&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

[footer.inc]
Copyright / Disclaimer
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

[sample.asp]
&lt;!--#include file=header.inc--&gt;
&lt;!-- main body of page here --&gt;
&lt;!--#include file=footer.inc--&gt;

</pre>
<h3>Powerful</h3>

When developing a web site under ASP, one has access to a complete 
set of objects and events, my favorite being $Session, which was one of ASP's
key selling points for me.  $Session is ASP's answer to the problem of HTTP being a 
stateless protocol.  By using temporary session cookies, each web user 
has a unique $Session in which you may store data, and that follows them from
script to script. Because the data storage
for $Session is handled on the server, you do not have to worry about
size limits of cookies as an alternate mechanism of storing user session data.
<p>
There are some very useful events as well.  Let's say that you are
using <tt>$Session->{login}</tt> to control a user account login and logout.  Because
$Session automatically times out every SessionTimeout, if a user
walks away from her/his computer for SessionTimeout minutes, the
<tt>$Session->{login}</tt> is destroyed along with the rest of the data stored in 
$Session, and the next person that uses the computer will find themselves
automatically logged out from the account.  This is a huge security win if 
you maintain a set of accounts at your web site that hold sensitive information like
credit card numbers.
<p>
Here is a basic listing of the built-in <a href=http://www.apache-asp.org/objects.html>objects</a> 
available to the developer within every <a href=http://www.apache-asp.org>Apache::ASP</a>
script:
<pre>
	Object		-	Function
	------			--------
	$Session	-	session state
	$Response	-	output
	$Request	-	input
	$Application	-	application state
	$Server		-	OLE support + misc.
</pre>

You might be looking at the $Application object as saying "huh, what's that?".
Simply, $Application allows you to share data between various ASP scripts
and users.  Metaphorically it represents your web site as an application,
and $Application is initialized when the first user $Session is created,
and destroyed when the last user $Session is destroyed.
<p>
Events are triggered when these objects are created and destroyed.
In addition to data initialization and destruction, these events allow
the developer to define, in the global.asa, subroutines to be executed 
at these event times, providing hooks enabling the web site
to function easily as a dynamic software application.  The 
<a href=http://www.apache-asp.org/events.html>events</a>
are as follows:
<pre>
	Action			Event
	------			------
        Script_OnStart *	Beginning of Script execution
        Script_OnEnd *		End of Script execution
	Application_OnStart	Beginning of Application
	Application_OnEnd	End of Application
	Session_OnStart		Beginning of user Session.
	Session_OnEnd		End of user Session.

  * These are API extensions that are not portable, but were
    added because they are incredibly useful
</pre>
<p>
<h3>Fast</h3>
Execution speed is always important when picking your web application
environment ... shoot for the stars and design with the fastest
from the beginning, saving yourself a massive redesign later when 
your site becomes a success.  One of the motivations for not using PerlScript 
under IIS, a couple years ago, was that it was painfully slow, but has since been 
much improved.  

The <a href=http://perl.apache.org>mod_perl</a> project boasts a 20 times
speedup in CGIs handled by Apache::Registry, and it 
handles perl ASP scripts just as well under Apache::ASP, with
some performance lost because of all the objects initialization and 
events execution that ASP handles.  
<p>
The startup overhead on simple scripts is significantly more
when moving from CGI to ASP under mod_perl for Apache, at least 20%,  
as shown in my previous 
<a href=http://chamas.com/bench/>Hello 
World - Web Application Benchmarks</a> article, but this startup overhead
will become relatively less important as your scripts get longer, and 
a base rate of 75 Apache::ASP requests per second on a PII 300 Solaris 
x86 is nothing to scoff at!
<p>
In order to justify using ASP over CGI despite the performance hit, 
just remember how much more <b>maintainable</b> and <b>powerful</b> ASP is.  The general
consensus is that developer time is much more valuable than 
computer time so save the former where possible!

<h3>Next Month</h3>
In this article I tried to convey a sense of how and why you might
use <a href=http://www.apache-asp.org/>Apache::ASP</a> to build
your web site.  Next month we will build a simple web site using
some of the powerful and modular features ASP has to offer.
